# Fetal-Health-Study
Prediction and classification of fetal health to prevent child and maternal mortality.
Child mortality reduction is represented in several of the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals and is an important indicator of human progress.
The UN wants countries to stop preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five by 2030, with all countries aiming to cut under-five mortality 
to at least 25 per 1,000 live births.<br />
Maternal mortality, which accounts for 295 000 fatalities during and after pregnancy and childbirth, runs parallel to the concept of child mortality (as of 2017). 
The vast majority of these deaths (94%) happened in low-resource settings, and the vast majority could have been avoided.<br />
In light of the foregoing, cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a straightforward and inexpensive way for healthcare practitioners to examine fetal health,
allowing them to take action to reduce infant and maternal mortality. The instrument sends ultrasound pulses and reads the response, 
revealing light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions, and other factors.<br />

## Objective
We create machine learning algorithms that can accurately predict and classify the health of the fetus. This will be done in the following stages: 
1.Data Cleaning <br />
2.Exploration <br />
3.Feature Engineering <br />
4.Modelling <br />
5.Selection of the best model.<br />
